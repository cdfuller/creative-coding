# creative-coding

Mixing logic and art is one of my passions and this is where I hold many of my smaller projects that I want to share. Most projects are either in Processing or p5js. I hope to add some WebGL and C++ projects in the future.

### Demos

* [Orbits](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/orbits)
	* Drawing lines between planets orbiting at different speeds

* [Cubes](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Cubes/p5js-port/)
	* Isometric cubes drawn at random. I want to add the option to specifiy colors, cubify an image, and other various rules.
* [Light Stretcher](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/light-stretcher/)
	* Stretch bright pixels along configurable headings to layer glitch trails with multiple priority modes.
* [Mathematical Roses](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Math_Roses/)
	* Created with some modifications following the tutorial [Coding Challenge #55: Mathematical Rose Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5QBExMNB1I) by Daniel Shiffman
* [Perlin Noise Flow Fields](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Flow_Fields/)
	* Based off of [Coding Challenge #24: Perlin Noise Flow Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY) by Dan Shiffman
* [Reas Circles](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Reas_Circles/)
	* First steps towards recreating the [work of Casey Reas](http://reas.com/compendium_lecture/)

### Tools
* [p5.js blend modes](https://fuller.codes/creative-coding/tools/blend-modes/)
	* Tool for understanding the different blend modes in p5
