# creative-coding

Mixing logic and art is one of my passions and this is where I hold many of my smaller projects that I want to share. Most projects are either in Processing or p5js. I hope to add some WebGL and C++ projects in the future.

### Demos

* [Cubes](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Cubes/p5js-port/)
	* Isometric cubes drawn at random. I want to add the option to specifiy colors, cubify an image, and other various rules.
* [Mathematical Roses](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Math_Roses/)
	* Created with some modifications following the tutorial [Coding Challenge #55: Mathematical Rose Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5QBExMNB1I) by Daniel Shiffman
* [Reas Circles](http://fuller.codes/creative-coding/Reas_Circles/)
	* 	First steps towards recreating the [work of Casey Reas](http://reas.com/compendium_lecture/)
